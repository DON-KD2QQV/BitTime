# ðŸ§ª Call for Beta Testers - BitTime Binary Clock App

## Help Launch BitTime on Google Play Store! ðŸš€

I need **12 testers** to help me promote BitTime from closed testing to production on Google Play Store. This is the final step before public launch!

### What is BitTime?
A beautiful binary clock app that helps you learn to read time in binary format - perfect for developers, STEM students, and amateur radio operators!

2. **Accept the Google Play invitation** (you'll get an email)
3. **Download and open the app** once (that's it!)
4. **Optional**: Leave feedback if you'd like

### Why Help?
- **Support open source development** 
- **Get early access** to the app before public release

- **It takes just 5 minutes of your time**
